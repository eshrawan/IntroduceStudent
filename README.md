## PET_SHELTER_SWIFT

### App Description

This app counts a person's name, last name, school and number of pets they have, and if they would like more pets. An alert is created, which also gives the option for
a user to enter in their phone number to sign up for further updates. Ways to improve: add persistence so all this custom data can be shown on load.
